Meeting with Ash and Manos - 4 March 2018

Expand scope of paper so it looks reviews larger selection of models and examines the recovery.
Model after Bhatia 2014 Decision paper.


Structure of paper


Random generation of stimuli
 - parameter recovery (examine precision of estimation)
 - model mimicry, fit each model to each simulated dataset and see if wrong model wins
 
   - discounting models (hyperbolic, 
   - trade-off models
   - drift diffusion models


Static choice set used in literature
 - do same
 


Adaptive design
 - define reward space and delay space. Factorial combination
 - same



Do some reading, have a think about which models to include and which item sets.


#Meeting - 16 May 2018

#We need to start small build up from there.

#Start with Cheng, Gonzalez-Vellejo (2016) item set (Experiment 1)

#Models

#Proportional difference (Eq 1 & 2) Pr = Normcdf(d), sigma and delta are free parameters. alpha is fixed to some maximum value.

#Hyperbolic (Eq 3 & 4), k and sigma are free parameter. (don't include S parameter)

#Tradeoff model (Eq 5), gamma, tau, eps, kappa, theta, alpha are free parameter

#Check Ericson supplementary materials for hyperbolic and tradeoff model code

#Start with maximum likelihood


#TODO: Code up models

#For future:
#Two delayed options, vs One immediate? Random choice set ?
